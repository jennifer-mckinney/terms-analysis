"""P9 review gate (terms-analysis#191).

Run as the last step of each job in .github/workflows/p9-review.yml, after
the reviewer has written p9-verdict.json. The job passes only when the file
is exactly the verdict contract with verdict PASS and an empty findings list.

Contract (written by the reviewer, see .github/p9/*.md):
    {"verdict": "PASS" | "FAIL",
     "findings": [{"severity": ..., "title": ..., "file": ..., "line": ...}]}
Key sets are exact. severity is one of SEVERITIES (exact spelling), title and
file are non-blank strings, line is a non-negative int (bool is refused).

Exit codes:
    0  PASS with zero findings (prints "P9 verdict: PASS, 0 findings")
    1  the reviewer reported FAIL, or listed findings
    2  the file is missing, unreadable, not JSON, or off the contract

Standard library only, so the step needs nothing installed.
